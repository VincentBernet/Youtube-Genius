# Components Coding Standards

This file defines our Components coding conventions for Copilot code review.

- Keep components as small as possible
- Separate UI from the business logic
- Extract utils from your components, so you can test those utils
- Always use Flowbite components. Search for components in the Flowbite documentation at: [URL]. Create wrapper components in the design-system-components folder.'
